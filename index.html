    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Inline - ny using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an enternal CSS . is to keep the styles in external CSS files. </li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However.<span class="item-four"> in this tutorial we weill use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is rasier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>

    <p>In CSS, sclectors are used to target a specific element or range of elementson a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

    <p>There is wide range of sclectors a electors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
